This Gate is part of the Channel of The Prodigal, The Design of the Witness, linking the G Center (Gate 13) to the Throat Center (Gate 33). Gate 13 is part of the Collective Sensing (Abstract) Circuit with the keynote of sharing.

With its gift for hearing, seeing and storing secrets, Gate 13 provides continuity between the past and the future in its role as the listener. The theme of confidante and a keeper of secrets is present during this transit. People naturally share their experiences with those that genuinely enjoy hearing their stories, their adventures, victories and challenges. Those that carry this gate are quite comfortable simply holding inside them what has been shared. Gate 13 is not pressured by the Throat Center to speak. We will recognize the right moment to share what is most valuable from our remembering because it will be drawn from us by people who are able to properly select, reflect upon and organize it for sharing with the broader community, such as people with Gate 33. The important lessons, which can only be learned through experience, are held and cherished until the time is right to contribute to humanity's understanding of itself. Historical continuity informs our future as a species. Without Gate 33, secrets may never be shared.

### Line 5 - The saviour

**☀️ Exaltation:** The charismatic genius who can find a role for everyone. The listener that has a gift for finding a role for others.

**🌑 Detriment:** The able administrator. Given the extreme positive nature of this position, mundane application is rare. The listener whose gift for finding a role for others is practical and suited to administration.
