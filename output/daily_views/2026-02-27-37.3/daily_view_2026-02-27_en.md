This Gate is part of the Channel of Community, A Design of Being a Part Seeking a Whole, linking the Solar Plexus Center (Gate 37) with the Ego Center (Gate 40). Gate 37 is part of the Tribal (Ego) Circuit with the keynote of support.

Gate 37 is the most communal gate in the BodyGraph. When others recognize our power, we can hold both a family and a community together with our warmth, friendliness and nurturing nature. We have an ability to make an emotional connection with others through touch, and an uncommon sensitivity, which senses their accessibility or openness to us. People will want us to be their organization's representative, and to welcome the newcomer or stranger. It is an offer that we might happily agree to if the bargain, or what we receive in return, is sufficient and clearly agreed upon by all parties. Gate 37 is the gate of the mouth so the planning, gathering and preparing of food often play a central role in all our family and community gatherings. In the bargain between Gates 37 and 40, Gate 40 is the willing provider and we are the distributor of its assets and skills. Without Gate 40, we are looking for those who can deliver the resources needed by the community so that we have someone to bargain with, and something to distribute. What we most fear is getting trapped in or having to live up to the traditional Tribal roles.

### Line 3 - Evenhandedness

**☀️ Exaltation:** The ability to judge what behaviour is appropriate and to react in a balanced manner to transgressions. The possibility to have the sensitivity to know what behaviour is appropriate in a relationship.

**🌑 Detriment:** An ironic tendency to either test incessantly the borders of acceptability or to respond to the very same tendency in others with severity. The possible lack of sensitivity to what behaviour is appropriate.
