## *Gate of Spirit - The Quality of Spirit is in the Emotional Now*

> Abundance is strictly a question of spirit. At any given point, Spirit is not a matter of comparison but just the wonder that the cup (life) exists at all.)

This Gate is part of the Channel of Emoting, A Design of Moodiness, linking the Solar Plexus (Gate 55) to the Root Center (Gate 39). Gate 55 is part of the Individual (Knowing) Circuit with the keynote of empowerment.

Awareness of spirit is not a concept (Ajna) or instinct (Spleen) - it is an emotion (Solar Plexus). Abundance is a function of spirit; it is how we perceive what we are feeling, and the mood we are experiencing in the moment. The 55th gate is susceptible to the melancholic chemistry of the emotional wave, which is constantly moving through cycles of hope to pain. One moment our cup feels half empty and the next it feels half full. Our moods determine what is correct for us and when. If we are not in the mood to eat, work, make love, be sociable or create, it is not healthy for us to do so. When we feel like being alone, we don't attempt to explain or excuse ourselves; simply honor the mood and embrace being in the moment with our own creative inner self. Our most creative time is when we feel deeply melancholic. A thoughtful word to those around us when we are simply not in the mood to be social will help them to not personalize the emotional energy that they are feeling from us. We are open to people with Gate 39 provoking us so that we can perceive our spirit, and our moods, for ourselves. At any given point in our wave, how our spirit feels and emotes is not open to comparison, debate or influence by others. Spirit awareness arises out of the wonder that the cup exists at all. What we fear most is emotional emptiness or a lack of passion in life.

### Line 6 - Selfishness

**☀️ Exaltation:** Acquisition obsession that though alienating, is still indirectly beneficial materially to others. The possibility of finding the spirit through materialism.

**🌑 Detriment:** Where the material abundance exists, but no one gets to share its light. The 'no Moon' phase. The possibility that materialism becomes obsessive with a 'mean' spirit that will not share.
